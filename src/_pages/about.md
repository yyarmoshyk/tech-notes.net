This is the reload of the existing site. Initially all articles were written in Russian language but I was seeing traffic coming from other countries, so it was decided to re-brand the site into the international language that can be read by any developer or system engineer.
The original site was running with `WordPress CMS` that is outside of my interests today, so there is no cense to pay $$ every month for cloud server with `php`, `nginx` and `mysql` that is required to run WordPress.

The decision was taken towards [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) content management system.
All posts in this blog are available in the internet, so I don't see any risks sharing the source via [github.com](https://github.com/yyarmoshyk/tech-notes.net)

Right now I'm working on translation of most of the articles - I will not spend time on the posts that are not being read in the existing site.

The further plan is to extend the existing base with the new articles related to cloud, Ci/CD and other recent experience.
