This is another note of the kind: "I don't want to google for it next time I need it in few years"

Sometimes we need to store sensitive data in our git repository and it definitely should not be stored in plaintext. This is where [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) becomes very usefull. It allows to encrypt plaintext with the help of gpg keys. The enabledment is pretty simple.

## GPG part
First make sure that you have gpg installed of the latest version:
```bash
gpg --version
``````

Create a new key:
```bash
gpg --full-generate-key
```
Options to be defined:
1. RSA and RSA
1. 4096 bit
1. defined whatever expiry you want. Normal practice is 1 year.

## GIT repository part
List keys:
```bash
gpg -k
```

Inside your git repository run the following:
```bash
git-crypt init
git-crypt add-gpg-user USER_ID
```

Specify files to encrypt by creating a `.gitattributes` file:
```bash
secret.txt filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
*.key filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
```

You'll need to git-add and git-commit the newly created files
```bash
git add .gitattributes
git add .git-crypt
git commit .git-crypt .gitattributes -m "Added git crypt"
git push
```

That is it. The file will showup encrypted in your git repository

After cloning a repository with encrypted files, unlock with GPG:
```bash
git-crypt unlock
```

### Adding new key to repository
For example you need to add one more contributor to your repository. 

New contributor got to share his GPG key by exporting it:
```bash
gpg --armor --export USER_ID > USER_ID.gpg
```

You'll need to import it, trust it and add user:
```bash
gpg --import USER_ID.gpg
```
```bash
gpg ––edit–key D2B3EAAF9A8D5DB93CC30B26CCA243599CC80727B
> trust
> save
> quit
```
```bash
git-crypt add-gpg-user D2B3EAAF9A8D5DB93CC30B26CCA243599CC80727B
```
